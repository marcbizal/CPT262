            <h1>Academy Programs</h1>

            <p>The Trident Tennis Center offers a challenging and innovative Academy program, providing
            an intensive yet fun year-round tennis training program. Our program is designed to meet the
            comprehensive needs of a wide range of competitive junior tennis players, with a particular
            emphasis on individual education. Our goal is to help every junior reach his or her full
            potential on and off the court. Each program uses fed ball and live ball drills, adjusted to
            each group's level, to maximize player development.
